						If it has been awhile, I have been living in San Francisco since May 2009, when I moved up here to be a Software Engineer for Yelp.
						I spend most of my time at Yelp doing front-endy stuff, you know, <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Javascript and Python. Outside of those base technologies, I am really into <abbr title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</abbr>, <abbr title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr>, Activity Streams and anything else that makes the web more open and connected.
						If you are into this kind of stuff, check out my <a href="http://github.com/jeffmicklos" rel="me" class="outside-link">github profile</a> or <a href="jMicklos_resume.pdf" class="outside-link">download my super out of date résumé</a>.

						I am not a total nerd, though, I still love art and design &mdash; hopefully this page is testament to that.
						I am (like most, I would hope) into clean grid-based design that relies heavily on typographic hierarchy, or something.

					A couple years ago my dad found an old film <abbr title="Single Lens Reflex">SLR</abbr> camera in a closet and gave it to me.
					Having never taken pictures on film before, I thought it would be a fun experiment. At that point, I could have never imagined how much I would suck at it.
					Lucky for me, this trusty old camera would make all my pictures look relatively passable, a huge plus.
					Way more importantly, I think of Thom Yorke (or even Colin Greenwood, I don't care) came across this lil' page, he might be impressed with these photos.
					And let's be honest, that is why I take pictures.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="twenty forty-top twenty-bottom">I get paid to type on a keyboard.</h3>
				
				<p>
					This fact will always blow my mind and I am incredibly grateful for it.
					Sometimes I even get paid for moving pixels around to make pretty pictures.
					During the 36-hour period of the Yelp hackathon, I designed an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwVoir5HSo" class="outside-link" title="stteeeelllllaaaaaaa!!">iPad app and bookmarklet</a> for our beer keg.
					Quite similarly, I <a href="images/wuyee_homepage.jpg" class="outside-link" target="_blank" title="this is totally going to open up a .jpg in a new window, enjoy!">designed the website</a> for Wu Yee, a non-profit child care center in San Francisco.
					While those are the two most recent things, you can see a pretty large and scarily archaic collection of my not-so-new work in my <a href="http://jeffmicklos.com/old" class="outside-link">old porfolio</a>.

							If Ok Computer and In Rainbows were never conceived, Arcade Fire would have a running chance to be better than Radiohead (someday, at least). I say this with confidence after just seeing Arcade Fire put on an amazing show at the Greek Theater, a show that easily ranks in my top 5 best performances. Although, the whole time I kept thinking how much Joe, Hazz and Mark would have enjoyed it. Interesting to note, this concert came exactly five years after seeing Sigur Ros for the first time.***

							One huge philosophical qualm that comes with time travel is the tracking of self. Before we dive deeper into the matrix, I am going to assume that a) you believe in time travel and b) you believe that time travel produces a replicate version of yourself. If you do not prescribe, this would be a good time to go make a sandwich. So you get bored one day, make a branch of yourself and send it back six months in time (or however long, time is not the issue here, even though it totally is). You are now concurrently living two lives but which one is your life? The short answer is both, the long answer is neither.

							I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently but I think I am coming back from it, so fear not. Anyways, there are outstanding topics that I need to tell you guys! Such as, did you know that Coffee Grounds in Rancho actually has grade-A coffee? Surprising, huh? However, not everything is as ~*blasé*~ as that, I promise! For instance, I think that the fact that I bought a generously sized tub to put assorted crap into is pretty cool. The aforementioned tub is actually a Roughneck Jumbo and I put my own person Seal-of-Approval on it.
